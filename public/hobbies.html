<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Abhaydyuti Singha - a passionate and self-driven Computer Science student at UEM Kolkata, <br>
  currently in my 7th semester. I’m highly enthusiastic about software engineering, emerging technologies,<br> 
  and building creative tech solutions that make life easier and more exciting.<br></p>
  
<p> With a solid foundation in Java, C, Data Structures & Algorithms, and web development, I’m focused on <br>
  becoming a skilled Software Engineer. I've also worked on small frontend projects and an image classification <br>
  system as part of a long-term Machine Learning project.<br>s
  My goals are ambitious — I’m working hard to land an internship at a top product-based company.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I love designing, imagining new tech gadgets, writing lyrics, editing videos, and exploring<br>
  creative side projects. I believe in learning by doing, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges and <br>
  opportunities that push my limits.<br></p>
  
  <p>Let’s build something amazing together.<br></p>
